## Overview  

The **Amazon Delivery Analysis** project provides in-depth insights into delivery performance using real-world data. This **Streamlit-based web application** allows users to explore delivery trends, analyze performance metrics, and uncover factors affecting delivery efficiency.  

The project leverages **data visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning models** to identify key patterns in delivery times, customer satisfaction, and logistics efficiency.  

With an **interactive dashboard**, users can easily filter data, compare delivery metrics, and gain actionable insights to improve delivery operations.  

## Features 🚀  
- **Delivery Time Analysis** 📊: Visualize delivery performance and delays.  
- **Geospatial Insights** 🌍: Explore delivery trends across different locations.  
- **Customer Satisfaction Metrics** ⭐: Analyze ratings, feedback, and delivery success rates.  
- **Predictive Analytics** 🔍: Use machine learning to estimate delivery times.  
- **Interactive UI** 🎛️: Built with **Streamlit** for real-time data exploration.  

## How It Works 🛠️  

1. **Data Collection & Processing**  
   - Extracts delivery data (time, location, status, ratings, etc.).  
   - Cleans and pre-processes the data for analysis.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualizes delivery trends, peak times, and anomalies.  
   - Analyzes customer reviews and satisfaction scores.  

3. **Machine Learning Predictions**  
   - Predicts delivery times based on historical data.  
   - Identifies factors that impact on-time deliveries.  

4. **Streamlit Web App**  
   - Users can explore **interactive dashboards** with customizable filters.  
   - Generates insights on delivery efficiency and potential improvements.  

## Installation & Setup ⚙️  

### Prerequisites  
Ensure you have the following installed:  

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

- Python 3.x  
- Streamlit
